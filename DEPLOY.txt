Deploying is a bit of a messy process at the moment:

(1) Merge master into gh-pages branch.

(2) Comment out /dist from the .gitignore file.

(3) Run 'npm run build' to make a production build.

(4) git add dist && git commit -m "Another dist subtree commit"

(5) git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages

(6) Go to https://github.com/drskinner/650vue/settings and
    under "GitHub Pages", set the source to 'gh-pages branch'.
    GitHub Pages may take several minutes to build.

    It may be necessary to switch to master and back to gh-pages
    to force a rebuild.

(7) The deployed app will be at https://drskinner.github.io/650vue/

When returning to the dev environment, revert the .gitignore file.
